    - Added a README.WINDOWS to help with the complexity of installing
      Crypt::SSLeay under that platform.
    - Added the ability to send attachments ( Thank you Daniel Stutz )
    - Added encrypt_session, which allows you to encrypt your entire
      Gmail session, not just the logon process.
    - Added the ability to pull ads.  Ads are automatically pulled when
      you request a message thread.
    - Removed reference to META.YML in the manifest.
    - Fixed some spelling errors ( I think I do this everytime. )
    - Fixed example scripts, changed reference of $Gmail::FOLDERS to
      $Mail::Webmail::Gmail::FOLDERS ( thanks tristan! )
    - Fixed parsing error when there were unmatched square brackets
      in a field ( Thanks again Daniel! )
    - Proxy support has stopped working for me, not sure if its an
      issue with the proxy I've been using, or if its an issue with
      the update I did to the logon process in 0.08.  ( After more testing
      it appears that something changed with the proxy that Im using,
      further investigation will be required to find out what I can do
      to fix it.  Let me know if this breaks for anyone else. )
    - I have met all of my goals for 1.0, so I guess this is the first
      1.0 candidate, let me know what you think.
